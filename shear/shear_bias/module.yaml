explanation: |
    Errors in cosmic shear measurement can lead to a multiplicative factor
    scaling the observed shear spectra.

    This module scales the measured C_ell to account for that difference,
    assuming model values of the multiplicative factor m, either per bin or for all bins.

    Since the bias can be different in different bins we have, for the general case
    including cross-spectra:

    :math:`C^{ij}_\ell -> (1+m_i)(1+m_j) C^{ij}_\ell`

    m_per_bin:
        meaning: If T use a separate m for each bin, otherwise a single global one
