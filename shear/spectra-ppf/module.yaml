-   The Limber integral is valid on the scales in question

explanation: >
    DEPRECATED: You should use the module cosmosis-standard-library/structure/projection_ppf/project_2d_ppf.py instead.

    This variant of the wl_spectra module includes modified gravity
    via the phenomenological D(k,z) which modifies the lensing kernel.
    Compare equations 33 and 34 of http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.4583v3.pdf

    The Limber approximation integrates a 3D power spectrum over the radial
    direction to get a 2D angular power spectrum.  It is an approximation 
    which is only valid on smaller scales.

    :math:`C_\ell =  A \int_0^{\chi_1} W_1(\chi) W_2(\chi) P(k=l/\chi, z(\chi)) / \chi^2 d\chi`


    The full integral must integrate over k(\ell) also.

    For weak lensing, the power spectrum is the matter power spectrum and the two
    kernel functions W depend on the redshift bins being used and the geometry.

    Parts of this code and the underlying implementation of limber are based on cosmocalc:
