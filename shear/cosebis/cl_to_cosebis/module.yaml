explanation: |
    COSEBIs (Complete Orthogonal Sets of E/B-Integral) are a set of alternative two-point statistics 
    designed to separate E/B-modes completely on a finite angular range. They have a reasonably localised
    response to Fourier modes, ell, and are also easy to measure from data. This module calculates both E_n and B_n 
    log-COSEBIs from https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2136.

    The expectation value of B-modes is zero if there is no B-mode power spectra. 
    To calculate B-mode COSEBIs simply switch input_section_name to take B-mode Cls as input 
    and output_section_name to avoid mixing E/B-modes.

    For this CosmoSIS edition we include the cl_to_cosebis mode for a KiDS-1000 or DES+KiDS
    joint analysis.  This is taken from the public COSEBIs library of software https://github.com/maricool/2pt_stats
    which includes additional software to convert xi_pm measurements into COSEBIs and calculate covariance matrices.
    Note the 'maricool' version also includes additional capability to marginalise over an uncertain c-term which we
    do not include here for simplicity.
