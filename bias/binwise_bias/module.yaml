assumptions:
-   Galaxy bias is specified per redshift bin
-   Bias values are independent for each bin

explanation: |
    "This module applies galaxy bias on a per-bin basis to galaxy power spectra.
    It reads bias values for each redshift bin and applies them to the appropriate
    auto- and cross-power spectra. Note that it only affects the galaxy_cl spectra
    not any galaxy-matter spectra.
    
    For each pair of bins (i,j), the power spectrum is multiplied by b_i * b_j
    where b_i and b_j are the bias values for bins i and j respectively."
