    "
    The likelihood of a suite of time delay system from strong lenses,
    as collected in Wong et al., 2019, arXiv:1907.04869

    Various different pieces of the likelihood can be switched on and off
    using the data\_ parameters.  The default configuration matches that
    in the released MontePython code.
