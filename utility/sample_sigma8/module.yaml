assumptions:
-   Spectra scale quadratically with sigma_8

explanation: |
    Boltzmann codes like CAMB and CLASS typically take a primordial power spectrum
    amplitude A_s as an input parameter defining the amplitude of cosmic structure
    fluctutations.

    Late-time data sets more naturally measure a late-time amplitude, and the measure
    sigma_8 is usually instead for these data.  If all other cosmological parameters
    are fixed A_s ~ sigma_8^2, but when other parameters can vary they are not
    perfectly equivalent.

    This module enables you to sample over sigma_8 while still passing A_s into a
    Boltzmann code.  It does this by using an input value sigma8_input, which can
    be sampled over, and a fixed fiducial A_s value.  After the Boltzmann code is run
    and sigma_8 for the fiducial amplitude calculated, the CMB and matter power spectra
    are scaled by (sigma8_input**2)/(sigma8_boltzmann**2), and sigma_8 is overwritten.
