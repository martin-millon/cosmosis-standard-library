    BAO people sometimes sample using the best-constrained BAO parameter r_d * h,
    where r_d is the sound horizon at the drag epoch (last scattering). This module
    takes a set of distances and rescales them to be consistent with a given value of
    r_d * h. This is useful for replicating, for example, the DESI BAO-only analysis.

    For that reason this module is limited to rescale distances, and not, for example.
    k values in a power spectrum.

    In general I'd discourage people from sampling in whatever is the best-constrained
    parameter for their particular analysis - it doesn't correspond to particularly
    sensible priors in any other parametrization. But it can make sampling more efficient,
    depending on the sampler.

    Specifically, this module reads a value of rd_prime computed from a (fixed) value
    of H0, e.g. by camb, and a sampled rdh_sample value, from which it computes
    rd_sample = rdh_sample / h_fid. It then sets f = rd_prime / rd_sample, and muliplies
    all the distance metrics by f.  H(z) is also rescaled by 1/f, and mu(z) adjust accordingly too.

    This module is not intended to be used in a general way, but only in the context of
    the specific BAO analysis described above.
