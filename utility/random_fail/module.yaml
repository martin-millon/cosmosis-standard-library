explanation: |
    "This utility module randomly fails pipeline runs with a specified probability.
    This is useful for testing the robustness of sampling algorithms and pipeline
    error handling.
    
    The module generates a random number and compares it to the specified failure
    fraction. If the random number is below the threshold, the module returns
    an error code causing the pipeline to fail."

params:
    fraction:
        meaning: Probability of random failure (0.0 = never fail, 1.0 = always fail)
        type: real
        default: 0.1
    seed:
        meaning: Random seed for reproducible failure patterns
        type: int
        default: 6789
    verbose:
        meaning: Whether to print when randomly failing
        type: bool
        default: false
