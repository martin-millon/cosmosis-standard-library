explanation: |
    The astropy cosmology library can compute background evolution distances as a function
    of redshift for a range of different cosmologies:

    - FlatLambdaCDM
    - FlatwCDM
    - Flatw0waCDM
    - LambdaCDM
    - wCDM
    - w0waCDM
    - w0wzCDM
    - w0wzCDM
    - wpwaCDM

    This module requires the user to choose one of these models and then will read
    the appropriate parameters for that model and compute a range of distance measures.
