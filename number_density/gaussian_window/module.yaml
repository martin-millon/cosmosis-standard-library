assumptions:
-   Gaussian window in redshift

explanation: |
    "This very simple module sets up fixed redshift n(z) bins for weak lensing.
     We should probably upgrade it to take the redshift and sigma from the 
     sampling instead of the ini file."
params:
    z:
        meaning: Redshift(s) of the bins
        type: real or real 1d
        default:
    sigma:
        meaning: Width of the bins in redshift
        type: real or real 1d
        default:
inputs: {}
outputs:
    wl_number_density:
        nz:
            meaning: Number of redshift samples
            type: int
        nbin:
            meaning: Number of bins
            type: int
        z:
            meaning: Redshift sample values
            type: real 1d
        bin_{i}:
            meaning: n(z) at redshift sample values.  bin_1, bin_2, ...
            type: real 1d
