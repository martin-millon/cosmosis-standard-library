assumptions:
-   Underlying true number density has Smail distribution
-   Photometric errors are sigma(z) = sigma_0 (1+z)
-   Bias fixed with redshift (if included)
-   Galaxies evenly divided between bins

explanation: >
    This module takes inputs that specify the underlying spectroscopic (true) redshift
    distribution of the galaxies in the survey.  It then convolves this with a photometric
    error :math:`\sigma(z) = \sigma_0 (1+z)` and optionally biases it.  It computes bin edges in the
    survey assuming equal numbers in each.
    
    You can also specify fixed bin edges.

    z_edges:
        meaning: >
            Manually specified redshift bin edges. If nbin - 1 values passed,
            these are the bounds of photometric selection for those nbin bins.
            If 2 values are passed, they specify a minimum and maximum redshift between
            which galaxies are divided into equal number samples.
