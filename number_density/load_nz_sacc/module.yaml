assumptions:
-   SACC file contains n(z) tracer data
-   All bins have the same redshift grid

explanation: |
    "This module loads number density n(z) distributions from a SACC (Save All 
    Correlations and Covariances) file format. SACC is a standard format for storing
    cosmological survey data including n(z) information.
    
    The module searches for tracers matching the specified data set names and
    extracts their redshift distributions. It validates that all bins use the
    same redshift grid and outputs the data in CosmoSIS format."
