assumptions:
-   'Simple photo-z bias models: n(z) -> n(z-b) or n(z*(1-b))'

explanation: |
    Photometric redshift distributions can contain biases - the actual distribution
    of galaxies in a survey can be different to the estimated one.

    This bias can remain even after calibration with a spectroscopic sample, or by other methods.

    This module models the simplest possible type of n(z) bias - a simple shift in z by a multiplicative
    or additive factor. The idea is that the shift parameter should be marginalized in sampling over to 
    account for this bias.  Note that this is *not* the same as simply widening the n(z).

    Ranges or priors should be put on the size of the bias that reflect your knowledge of remaining
    possible biases.

    The mode is:
    n(z) -> n(z-b) or n(z*(1-b))
params:
    mode:
        meaning: "'multiplicative' or 'additive', depending on what kind of bias model\
            \ you want"
        type: str
        default:
    sample:
        meaning: If set, look for n(z) in the section called sample, and
            error parameters in sample_errors
        type: str
        default:
    bias_section:
        meaning: If set, look for input parameters in this named section
            instead of wl_photoz_errors. If not set but sample is set, look in sample_errors
        type: str
        default:
    interpolation:
        meaning: Type of interpolation to use in scipy.interpolate.interp1d
        type: str
        default: cubic
    per_bin:
        meaning: Whether to use one value per bin, If False, use one value for all bins.
        type: bool
        default: true
    output_deltaz_section_name:
        meaning: If set, compute the mean of the shifted n(z) and writes it to the
            specified section.
        type: string
        default:
inputs:
    wl_number_density:
        nbin:
            meaning: Number of redshift bins
            type: int
            default:
        z:
            meaning: Redshift sample points of n(z) estimates
            type: real 1d
            default:
        bin_i:
            meaning: n(z)for i=1..nbin. n(z) estimates
            type: real 1d
            default:
    wl_photoz_errors:
        bias_i:
            meaning: For i=1..nbin if per_bin=T or i=0 otherwise. Bias delta-z for this
                bin.
            type: real
            default:
outputs:
    wl_number_density:
        bin_i:
            meaning: n(z) for i=1..nbin. Modified n(z) estimates replaced old value
            type: real 1d
    delta_z_out:
        bin_i:
            meaning: mean of the new n(z) for i=1..nbin.
            type: real 1d
