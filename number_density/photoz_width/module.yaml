-   'Simple photo-z bias models: n(z) -> n(a(z-mu)+mu)'

explanation: |
    Photometric redshift distributions can contain biases - the actual distribution
    of galaxies in a survey can be different to the estimated one.

    This bias can remain even after calibration with a spectroscopic sample, or by other methods.

    This module models an additional stretch around the mean to the n(z) distribution.

    The mode is:
    n(z) -> n(a(z-mu)+mu)
params:
    mode:
        meaning: "The type of transformation to apply; currently only the default 'stretch' option is supported for this parameter"
        type: str
        default: stretch
    sample:
        meaning: If set, look for n(z) in the section called sample, and
            error parameters in sample_errors
        type: str
        default: wl_number_density
    bias_section:
        meaning: If set, look for input parameters in this named section
            instead of wl_photoz_errors. If not set but sample is set, look in sample_errors
        type: str
        default:
    interpolation:
        meaning: Type of interpolation to use in scipy.interpolate.interp1d
        type: str
        default: cubic
    per_bin:
        meaning: Whether to use one value per bin, If False, use one value for all bins.
        type: bool
        default: true
inputs:
    wl_number_density:
        nbin:
            meaning: Number of redshift bins
            type: int
            default:
        z:
            meaning: Redshift sample points of n(z) estimates
            type: real 1d
            default:
        bin_i:
            meaning: n(z)for i=1..nbin. n(z) estimates
            type: real 1d
            default:
    wl_photoz_errors:
        width_i:
            meaning: For i=1..nbin if per_bin=T or i=0 otherwise. Bias delta-z for this
                bin.
            type: real
            default:
outputs:
    wl_number_density:
        bin_i:
            meaning: n(z) for i=1..nbin. Modified n(z) estimates replaced old value
            type: real 1d
