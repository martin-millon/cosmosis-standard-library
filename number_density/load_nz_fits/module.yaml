assumptions:
-   Data is provided in FITS extensions NZ\_{NAME}
-   There are various subtleties to do with the sampling and form of the n(z) data

explanation: |
    "This module is designed to work with the number density part of the FITS
    files described in:
    http://github.com/joezuntz/2point/

    High-precision analyses of two-point measurements require knowing *precisely* what
    is meant by a given n(z) analysis.  Most of the CosmoSIS standard library modules
    downstream of this one assume that the n(z) specifies sample points in a smooth
    curve, since that seems most physical.  Most photo-z codes, on the other hand,
    provide data in the form of histograms, with small bins in z having a constant
    assumed n(z) within them.

    The actual difference between these two forms is 
    usually well within the systematic errors associated with photometric
    redshift estimation, so if you're doing a realistic analysis the difference should
    be washed out.  But for code comparison exercises where you are trying to ensure 
    0.1% level differences they are very large. 

    The parameter 'upsampling' in this module is designed to address this. Higher upsampling
    values add new sample points in between the existing ones, so that the two forms
    look much closer.

    A proper solution to this, where we use splines the parts of the code that actually
    use the n(z) that understand the histogram form, is in our roadmap.
