explanation: |
    "
    The gradient of the cumulative galaxy luminosity function \alpha is sensitive to both redshift and magnitude limit of the survey 
    considered. Joachimi & Bridle (2010) extend the fitting function of Blake & Bridle (2005) to obtain a polynomial \alpha(z, r_lim) 
    at a range of redshifts, where z_i is the median in redshift bin i and r_lim is the r-band magnitude limit. Note that the fitting is based on ground-based
    data from the COMBO-17 survey. See Joachimi & Bridle (2010) for discussion of its applicability.
