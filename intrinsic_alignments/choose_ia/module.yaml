assumptions:
-   IA parameters have been computed with suffixed names

explanation: |
    "This utility module selects intrinsic alignment parameters from versions
    that have been computed with suffixed names. This is useful when multiple
    IA models or galaxy populations have been computed and stored with different
    suffixes, and you want to select one set as the primary IA parameters.
    
    The module looks for parameters with the specified suffix and copies them
    to the standard parameter names without the suffix."

params:
    suffix:
        meaning: Suffix to look for in parameter names
        type: str
        default: ""

inputs:
    intrinsic_alignment_parameters:
        parameter_suffix:
            meaning: IA parameter with suffix to be copied to standard name
            type: real or real 2d
            default:

outputs:
    intrinsic_alignment_parameters:
        parameter:
            meaning: IA parameter copied from suffixed version
            type: real or real 2d
