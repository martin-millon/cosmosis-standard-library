assumptions:
    - "The tomographic data and covariance are ordered in the standard CosmoSIS format"

explanation: |
    "This is a simple likelihood calculation that was set up for COSEBIs. In principle it could be used for any statistic
     provided you don't want to make any cuts to the data, theory and covariance (If you want to do something more complex 
     use 2pt_like.py).  It first reads in the tomographic data vector and covariance matrix from the block.  
     The theory is then also extracted and ordered according to the CosmoSIS convention.  
     The likelihood (data-model)^T C^{-1} (data-model) is returned.
