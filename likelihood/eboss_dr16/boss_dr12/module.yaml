explanation: >
    "This module is adapted from boss_dr12.py module in boss_dr12, to read
    the boss dr12 likelihood data as released by eBOSS DR 16. 
    The data files are from the BAO-only and BAO-plus (which the recomended one)
    directories. One notable difference is that the txt files only 
    contain boss dr12 measurements for the two lowest redshift bins.
    
    This module gives a likelihood of the comoving angular diameter
    distance D_m, the Hubble parameter H(z) and f*sigma_8.
    It uses the sound horizon at last-scatter rs_zdrag.

    A correlated Gaussian likelihood is then returned."
