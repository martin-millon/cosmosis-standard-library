explanation: |
    "Hillipop is a multifrequency CMB likelihood for Planck data. 
    The likelihood is a spectrum-based Gaussian approximation for cross-correlation spectra 
    from Planck 100, 143 and 217GHz split-frequency maps, with semi-analytic estimates of the 
    Cl covariance matrix based on the data. The cross-spectra are debiased from the effects of 
    the mask and the beam leakage using Xpol (a generalization to polarization of the algorithm 
    presented in Tristram et al. 2005) before being compared to the model, which includes 
    CMB and foreground residuals. They cover the multipoles from ell=30 to ell=2500."
