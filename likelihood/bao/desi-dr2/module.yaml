explanation: |
    Like DR1, the DESI DR2 release provided measurements of the sound horizon imprint on
    galaxy and quasar clustering, and the Lyman alpha forest. This module
    provides a likelihood for these measurements, assuming a Gaussian likelihood
    for the data, as presented in the accepted DESI DR1 paper.
