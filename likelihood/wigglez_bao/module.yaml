assumptions:
-   WiggleZ dark energy survey data set
-   FLRW metric and standard BAO size

explanation: |
    "This module gives a likelihood of the redshift-distance and redshift-Hubble
    relations in combined form D_v = (da**2 * (1+z)**2 * dr)**(1./3.) 
    where dr = z / H. It uses the sound horizon at last-scatter rs_zdrag and 
    the predicted expansion since last scattering to predict the BAO size
    at the redshifts at which the WiggleZ survey measured them.

    A correlated Gaussian likelihood is then returned."
