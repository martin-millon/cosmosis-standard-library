explanation: |
    "Important note: please see https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/ACT-DR6-parameters/blob/main/theories/camb.yaml
    for the default CAMB settings required for this likelihood to reproduce the published result. This also requires
    the use of the CosmoRec recombination module which is not supplied by default in CAMB. This repo also specifies 
    default priors for the likelihood, including the tau prior which should be used if no large scale CMB polarisation 
    data (e.g. from Planck SRoll2) is included.

    This is the full multi-frequency MFLike primary CMB likelihood from the ACT DR6 data release. This includes a 
    full set of foreground and instrumental systematics modelling parameters. For a lighter version of the likelihood 
    including only two nuisance parameters, which gives the same results in Lambda-CDM cosmologies, it is suggested to 
    use the `lite' version also provided.
    What is supplied here is only the CosmoSIS interface to the official Cobaya likelihood.
    This should be obtainable through installing the Cobaya likelihood from the provided github repository.
    The required data can be downloaded with the provided shell script."
