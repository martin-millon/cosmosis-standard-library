explanation: |
    Galaxy bias refers to the relative density of galaxies compared to underlying dark matter,
    and can be a function of scale and/or redshift.

    Jullo et al made measurements of galaxy bias for high and low mass samples.

    This module compares a predicted b(z) or b(k,z) from theory to these measurements.
