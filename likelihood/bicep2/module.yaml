-   BICEP2 2014-03-14 dataset

explanation: |
    "The 2014 BICEP2 results are a detection of cosmological B-modes
    on the scales that indicate a primordial gravitational wave bump.

    This module wraps the likelihood code released by the BICEP2 team.

    WARNING: The BICEP 2014 results are generally considered to be incorrect;
    this module is for historical interest only.
