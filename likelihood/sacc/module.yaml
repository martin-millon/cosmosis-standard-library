explanation: |
    "This module implements a general likelihood of tomographic 2-point measuremnts
    of various quantities, including galaxy density, cosmic shear, intrinsic alignments,
    CMB lensing, and the various cross powers between these.

    This is a first version of a general code using the SACC format developed for DESC.
    See github.com/LSSTDESC/sacc for more details

    Note a recent change: by default we now do not renormalize any bandpower weights,
    whereas before we did.  This is to allow for non-unit-sum weights such as those
    produced by NaMaster.

params:
    data_file:
        meaning: Filename of the sacc file to use.
        type: str
        default:
    data_sets:
        meaning: Space-separated list of which data sets from within
            the file to use for likelihoods.
        type: str
        default: all
    keep_tracers:
        meaning: Regular expression to select tracers to use.
        type: str
        default: ""
    angle_range_{dataset}_{i}_{j}:
        meaning: Pair of real numbers. If set, for the given data set and pair of
            bins, cut down the data used to this angular range  (min and max)
        type: str
        default:
    cut_{dataset}:
        meaning: Space-separated list of i,j pairs. (no spaces within the pair, just
            betwen them, e.g. cut_lss = 1,2  1,1  3,4.  Remove this bin from the likelihood.
        type: str
        default:
    "{name}_section":
        meaning: For each {name} in the data types used from the file, a cosmosis block section
            to look for the theory predictions in.
        type: str
        default: Various depending on name.
    save_theory:
        meaning: If set, save the theory predictions used in the likelihood to this sacc file.
        type: str
        default:
    save_realization:
        meaning: If set, save a simulated data set to this sacc file.
        type: str
        default:
    covariance_realizations:
        meaning: If >0, assume that the Covariance matrix was estimated from a set
            of MC simulations and should thus have the Anderson-Hartlap factor applied
            to increase its size. If zero, assume infinite number of realizations.
        type: int
        default: -1
    sellentin:
        meaning: If set, use the Sellentin-Heavens 2016 change to the likelihood to
            account for this distribution of the covariance estimates. This changes
            the likelihood to a student's-t form. Note that this invalidates the simulated
            data sets used for the ABC sampler.
        type: bool
        default: false
    like_name:
        meaning: The name of the likelihood to save.
        type: str
        default: 2pt
    likelihood_only:
        meaning: Skip saving the covariance, inverse, simulation, etc. Saves some time.
        type: bool
        default: false
    kind:
        meaning: The interpolation to do into the theory splines.

        ell:
            meaning: If a Fourier-space measurement is used, the angular wave-number
                of the predicted theory curves.  The name of the section here depends on the data type used from
                the file. It might be galaxy_cl or shear_cl, for example.

            default:
        bin_{i}_{j}:
            meaning: For various i,j depending what is found in the file, the theory
                predictions for this value. For example, C_ell.
