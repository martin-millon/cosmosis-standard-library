explanation: |
  This module combines tomographic / stellar mass bins of the individually calculated observables
  It produces the theoretical prediction for the observable for the full survey. 
  The number of bins and the mass range can be different to what is calculated in the hod_interface.py module.

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    input_section_name:
        meaning: Input section name to get the observable values from (this is and optional output of the hod section)
        type: str
        default: stellar_mass_function
    output_section_name:
        meaning: Output section name to save the observable values to
        type: str
        default: smf
    observable_type:
        meaning: Type of observable (either mass or luminosity).
        type: str
        default: mass
    correct_cosmo:
        meaning: To correct for fixed imput cosmology at which observable function was estiamted
        type: bool
        default: False
    sample:
        meaning: (optional) if nzs are given, look for the redshift distribution 
                  of the observables in this section. 
        type: str
        default: 
    zmin:
        meaning: minimum redshift value{s} for the observable in each bin. Used for cosmology correction.
        type: real
        default:
    zmax:
        meaning: maximum redshift value{s} for the observable in each bin. Used for cosmology correction.
        type: real
        default:
    cosmo_kwargs:
        meaning: A string of a dictionary of input cosmology values
        type: str
        default: "{'H0':70.0, 'Om0':0.3, 'Ode0':0.7}"
    astropy_cosmology_class:
        meaning: A astropy cosmology class which was used to calculate input cosmology at
        type: str
        default: "LambdaCDM"
inputs:
    input_section_name:
        obs_val_{i}:
            meaning: The value of the observable for bin {i}. This is taken from the HOD-pbservable output section.
                     i is an integer.
            type: real 1D
        obs_func_{i}:
            meaning: The value of the observable function for bin {i}. This is taken from the HOD-pbservable output section.
                     i is an integer. 
            type: real 1D (no redshift rependence) or 2D if z_bin_{i} exists
        z_bin_{i}:
            meaning: redshift distribution of the galaxies in the observable-redshift bin {i}. This will be read if it exists. 
                    If the median redshift is used to get the observable function then it is not used. If it exists then the
                    observable function is defined as the weighted average of the observable function over redshift
                    \int dz n(z) x (observable function).
            type: real 1D
    sample:
        z:
          meaning: Redshift values in the input sample corresponding to the galaxies in the observable-redshift bins. 
                    This should be read using a read_nz module. 
          type: real 1D
        bin_{i}: 
          meaning: Redshift distribution of the galaxies in the observable-redshift bins. The number of bins should be 
                  This should be read using a read_nz module. 
          type: real 1D
outputs:

        obs_{i}:
          meaning: The value of observable, for the observable-redshift bin {i}, either mass or luminosity
          type: real 1D
        nbin:
          meaning: Number of observable-redshift bins, it is 1 if suffixes is not given
          type: int
