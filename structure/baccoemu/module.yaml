explanation: |
    Baccoemu is a collection of cosmological neural-network emulators for large-scale structure statistics
    in a wide cosmological parameter space, including dynamical dark energy and massive neutrinos. 
    These emulators were developed as part of the Bacco project.
    
    We imported the Bacco Emulator code into this directory because the PyPI version of the code is not recent,
    and it has some dependencies that we would like to install from conda-forge rather than PyPI (tensorflow).
    We have to make one change to it to make it work on python 3.8 and 3.9 - replacing the progressbar2
    library with TQDM. A patch file with this change is included.
    
    The license for this package says copyright belongs to the python packaging authority, but that seems unlikely.

# List of parameters that can go in the params.ini file in the section for this module    
params:
    mode:
        meaning:
            What to emulate; the NL DM-only power, the baryonic boost, or both. Choose from 'nonlinear', 'baryons', 'nonlinear+baryons'. If 'baryons' is chosen then the NL power is read from the block (e.g. from camb). Otherwise the NL power is emulated.

#Inputs for a given choice of a parameter, from the values.ini or from other modules
#If no such choices, just do one of these omitting mode=something part:
