assumptions:
    - Pk_baryonic/Pk_nonlinear = Pk_hydro/Pk_DMonly

explanation: |
    "This module reads in Pk_nonlinear from previous modules modifies it, applying
    the ratio between DM-only and hydro simulations"

params:
    ratiotable:
        meaning: "Path to one of the ratio files supplied with in the module's data directory"
        type: str
        default: 

inputs:
    matter_power_nl:
        k_h:
            type: real 1d
            meaning: "sample values of nonlinear spectrum in Mpc/h"
            default: 
        z:
            type: real 1d
            meaning: "redshift of nonlinear spectrum samples"
            default: 
        p_k:
            type: real 2d
            meaning: "Nonlinear spectrum in (Mpc/h)^{-3}"
            default: 

outputs:
    matter_power_nl:
        p_k:
            type: real 2d
            meaning: "Nonlinear spectrum in (Mpc/h)^{-3}, modified in-place"
