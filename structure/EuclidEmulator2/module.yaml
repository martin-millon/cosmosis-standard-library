explanation: |
    Emulators like EE2 generate an approximation to the non-linear matter power spectrum
    by scaling the linear matter power spectrum by a boost factor. This boost factor is
    a function of redshift and wavenumber. 
    
    The boost factor is calculated from a set of
    simulations, and the emulator interpolates between these simulations to generate the
    boost factor for any redshift and wavenumber.
    
    The accuracy of the emulator is limited by the accuracy of the simulations.
