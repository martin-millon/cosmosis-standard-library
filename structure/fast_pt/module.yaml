explanation: |
    "The FAST-PT library computes a selection of quantities which are 
    integrals over the 3D matter power spectrum, coupled with itself by a
    mode-coupling kernel.

    This module runs that library to compute various terms that are useful
    for either intrinsic alignment calculations for the TATT model, and/or
    galaxy bias terms.

    This module is not fully documented yet
